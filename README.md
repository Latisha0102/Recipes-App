🍳 Recipes App

Welcome to my Recipes App! 👋

This is a project I built to help food lovers discover and organize their favorite meals. As an aspiring Full Stack Developer, this project was a fantastic way for me to practice handling dynamic content and creating a clean, appetizing user interface.

🌟 What does it do?

The Recipes App is designed to make cooking inspiration easy to find. Here are the core features:

• Recipe Gallery: Displays a list of various recipes with high-quality images and titles.

• Detailed Instructions: Each recipe card leads to a full view of the ingredients and step-by-step cooking methods.

• Dynamic Content: The app uses data mapping to automatically generate cards for every recipe in the system.

• Responsive Styling: I focused on making sure you can check recipes on your phone while you're in the kitchen or on your desktop.

🛠️ The Tech Stack

I used these technologies to build this culinary tool:

• HTML5 & CSS3 – For a solid structure and beautiful, responsive styling.

• JavaScript (ES6+) – To handle the logic and map through the recipe data.

• React – For building a fast, interactive, and component-based user interface.

• Bootstrap – To help with the layout and ensure it's mobile-friendly.

🚀 How to get it running

If you want to try it out on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   
   git clone https://github.com/Latisha0102/Recipes-App.git

   cd Recipes-App

3. Install the dependencies

Download all the packages needed for the app:

npm install

3. Start the project
   
Run the app in your local browser:

npm start

The app should open up at http://localhost:3000. 🥗✨

🚧 My Learning Journey

While building the Recipes App, I focused on:

1. API Integration: Learning how to fetch real-time culinary data to populate the app.

2. Component Reusability: Creating a single "Recipe Card" component that can be used for any dish.

3. UI/UX Design: Thinking about how to make a recipe easy to read while someone is actually cooking.
